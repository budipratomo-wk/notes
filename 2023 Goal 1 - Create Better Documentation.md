# Summary of the goal
One of the constants in software engineering role is having new stuff to learn. 
New repositories, new technologies, new best practices. They all keep coming
and demand a good sitting-down time to put them inside your brain. 
And as you learn new stuff, you forget the old one. 

Therefore, it's important to take a good snapshot or cache of what I've learned
as I go. 

This year, I've decided to commit to the zettelkasten method described [here](https://zettelkasten.de/introduction/).
This methodology, supported by the neovim extension, should provide me with 
the building blocks I need to start building up the documentation system that's 
easy to access and build up. 

# Why this goal 
I seem to not have the discipline in taking down the required notes and I always
need to relearn stuff from scratch whenever I'm revisiting the same topic after
a prolonged amount of time on vacation, for example. 

This is not a good habit to have if I'm to grow as a software engineer. So to 
ensure I can grow, best to fix the foundation, which is knowledge acquisition. 
This will open up new goals in the future, such as sharing knowledge to teammates, 
writing design docs, get involved in architecture discussion, and others. 



# How to measure it?
For any new project / topic, I should write down at least 1 note, stored as 
markdown file accessible in this github repo: [bpratomo-notes](https://github.com/budipratomo-wk/notes).
Comparing the amount of notes with the amount of PR I put in seems reasonable enough. 
Therefore I'm aiming at the ration of 1:1. 1 new note for 1 PR. 


# When do we know it is successful?
We know if it's successful, if the I achieved the following criteria: 
- I made it a habit to document stuff (1:1 note ratio)
- The notes are actually helpful, I can attach every note to the PR I'm building
and it should clear up the topic, instead of making it more confusing
