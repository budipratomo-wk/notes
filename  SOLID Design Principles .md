# What is SOLID?
- Single Responsibility
    > A class should only have one reason to change. 
    > A class should only have one job
- Open-Closed
    > Objects should be open for extension, but closed for modification
- Liskov Substitution
    > Every subclass should be substitutable to their base / parent class
- Interface Segregation 
    > A client shouldn't implement an interface it doesn't use. Prefer multiple
    interface as required
- Dependency Inversion
    > Entities must depend on abstraction, not low-level concrete implementations
