from [Jeff Trom's reflection](https://w-dev-blog.appspot.com/posts/2023/01/24/reflecting-on-jeffs-leadership-lessons/index.html)
- Hone on your stakeholder => Make presentation chaotic (jump wherever necessary)
- Hone on your truths 
    => Interpret questions as invitation to explore what is the real truth
    => Whenever you ramble, try to cut it down and say concisely what you 
        really mean
    => Chart out your designs to match your stakeholder. See [[non_code_learnings/topics/The C4 Model of note-taking]]
- Tighter Feedback loops == faster innovation
