Question: When do we actually execute changes in the Report DTO? 

- Is it when we click Apply?  Apparently the Apply button is only called upon selecting a new profile. 
- Is it when we click "Save Changes"
- Is it instantly when we made modifications on the dialog? if so, how do reverse that change?
