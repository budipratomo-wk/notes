title: 2023 Goal 3 - Write Better Code Faster
date:  2023-01-10

Need to merge code faster. Target to have one PR merged every two weeks at the minimum

- Look at job description 
- Look at github insights 
- Look at 

# Summary of the goal

This past quarter, my PR merging productivity is still under the 50% percentile.

I want to bump this up by
- Accelerate my learning process by making it a habit to create a documentation
so revisiting older topics can go faster
- writing better, clearer code that is easy to review so the review process can 
go faster
- organizing my workload so I can take on two PRs at once, so I can work toggle 
between them during PR review waiting process. 
- not opening up a PR that has a lot of dependencies and will not get merged
anytime soon. 




# Why this goal 
I want to be a more productive engineer, contributing high quality code swiftly

# How to measure it?
I'll be relying on the jellyfish metric. Specifically the PRs merged metric. 

# When do we know it is successful?
The goal is successful if I can get the PR merged count per week to be above 1
