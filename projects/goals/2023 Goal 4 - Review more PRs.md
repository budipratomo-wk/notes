# Summary of the goal

I want to contribute to higher quality code base. What better way to realize that
than participating in code reviews? 

For now, my goal for this year is to just to leave at least 1 comment as a review
in all the PRs where my review is requested. 


# Why this goal 
Participating in code reviews will allow me to get more exposure on  good quality 
code and also allow me to think about what does a good design mean. It will also
help promote discussion in the PRs that will ultimately lead to better codebase. 

# How to measure it?
I'll be relying on the jellyfish metric. Specifically the PRs merged metric. 

# When do we know it is successful?
The goal is successful if I can get the PR merged count per week to be above 1
