1. What should happen when a language is toggled off? Should it disappear or stay there?
2. If it should stay, what would be the basis for retention? Since the backend only exposed what's the enabled language at one time. 
3. In other tabs, any changes are saved immediately. Why is the behavior in the languages tab not consistent with that and is only saved when the apply button is clicked?
4. If a taxonomy only supports one language, should the language tab be disabled or be hidden?
5. [Comment] The text "This is preset in your document setting" might not be accurate since the document locale can be changed even if the default language is already set.
