# TODO
- [ ]Link the references to the docs here 

# Relevant repositories 
- xbrl-translator
- skaardb 
- wTranslate
- Read through the EDGAR pages in support.workiva.com

# Current flow 
- Export workiva doc as Word 
- Import doc to Amana 
- Amana will read the styles and export that into XML

# Future flow 
- Click save as (Iinstead of clicking the generate button)
- Get the generated XML (instead of )
- Leverage the wTranslate API.

German XML will be different compared to all the other XML exports and is a one-off.
The XML is freeform akin to HTML.

# Concerns 
- Malformed exports since we don't have too many samples to compare it with. 

# Phases 
- Phase 1 => Save as, single profile for everything
- Phase 2 => will have separate generation feature in one panel with multiple profiles
