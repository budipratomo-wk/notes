# Summary of the goal
As we join up with the regulatory reporting team, it's important to conceptually
understand what XBRl is, both from business-perspective and also from technical 
perspective. 

Therefore, I'm making it my goal thi year to read through on what it is, and 
present my learnings to my teammates.


# Why this goal 
# How to measure it?

For this goal to be marked as successful, I'd need to deliver the following 
items: 
- Breakdown of important topics I'd want to learn about XBRL 
- For each topic that I've learned, I'd need to deliver a few items: 
    - Conceptual overview of what the topic is about 
    - Technical explanation of why it matters 
    - How we're handling that in the code

I'm aiming to cover one topic per two months, hence 2 topics per quarter.  
This would need to be discussed whether it's a useful goal or not. 



# When do we know it is successful?

This goal is successful if I've delivered the content and made it useful for 
everyone.
